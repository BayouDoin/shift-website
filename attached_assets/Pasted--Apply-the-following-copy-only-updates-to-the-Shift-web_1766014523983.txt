Apply the following copy-only updates to the Shift website to improve emotional consistency, clarity, and tone.
Do not redesign the page, change layout, or modify any other sections not listed below.

1. Update the Hero 1–2–3 Section (Directly Under Hero CTAs)

Replace the existing three-step copy:

Current
	1.	Identify
Your biggest time and revenue leaks
	2.	Design
A custom automation plan
	3.	Implement
Only what pays for itself

Replace with:

1. Identify
Where work feels heavier than it should

2. Design
A clear, realistic path to remove that friction

3. Implement
Only what actually pays for itself

Keep numbering, spacing, and layout the same.

2. Results Section — Remove “Workflow” Language

In the Cisco case study, update the “What Was Built” description.

Replace:

Automated outbound and follow-up systems tied directly into sales workflows.

With:

Automated outbound and follow-up systems tied directly into how sales teams operate.

Do not use the word “workflow” anywhere in the Results section.

3. Results Section — Improve Interpretive Line Tone

For all interpretive lines added after each Outcome, replace sentences that begin with “This…” with language that anchors to lived experience.

Apply this pattern consistently:

Cisco

With:

Gate Gourmet

⸻

Local Law Firm
Replace:

⸻

4. CTA Button Copy (Optional Upgrade)

If feasible without layout changes, update the primary CTA button text in the final section.

Replace:

See What We’d Automate in Your Business

With:

See What AI Should Take Over

If this causes layout issues, keep the existing button text.

⸻

5. Footer Trust Line (Add One Line)

Just above the copyright line in the footer, add this single sentence in small, subtle text:

Clarity-first AI systems. No pressure. No long-term commitments.

Do not add links or buttons to this line.
