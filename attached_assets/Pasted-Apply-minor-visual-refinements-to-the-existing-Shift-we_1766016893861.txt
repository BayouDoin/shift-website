Apply minor visual refinements to the existing Shift website footer to improve balance, hierarchy, and finish.
Do not change layout structure or copy unless specified below.

⸻

1. Adjust Reassurance Line Spacing

Target the footer line:

Clarity-first AI systems. No pressure. No long-term commitments.

Make the following adjustments:
	•	Add slightly more padding above this line
	•	Reduce padding below it
	•	Ensure it reads as a header within the footer, not a banner

Do not change text size or wording.

⸻

2. Balance Left and Right Column Visual Weight

Left Column (Brand)
	•	Slightly reduce the font size or opacity of the tagline:
Enterprise-grade AI that removes friction from everyday work.
	•	Keep “SHIFT” unchanged in size and weight

Goal: reduce visual dominance without weakening brand presence.

⸻

Right Column (Explore / Connect)
	•	Increase font weight of the section labels:
	•	Explore
	•	Connect
	•	Keep link text unchanged in size and weight

Goal: better visual balance with the left column.

⸻

3. Tighten Link Vertical Spacing

For both the Explore and Connect lists:
	•	Reduce vertical spacing between links slightly
	•	Ensure links read as a compact list rather than separate blocks
	•	Maintain readability and clickability

Do not change link order or destinations.

⸻

4. Refine Social Link Alignment

For LinkedIn and Upwork links:
	•	Slightly reduce icon size
	•	Decrease spacing between icon and label text
	•	Align icon + text vertically with the link rhythm of the Explore list

Icons should feel like navigation elements, not decorative accents.

⸻

5. Preserve Overall Aesthetic

Constraints:
	•	Do not add new colors
	•	Do not change fonts
	•	Do not add animations
	•	Do not add new content or links
	•	Maintain the dark, minimal, calm aesthetic

Completion Criteria

	•	Feel visually balanced left to right
	•	Feel calmer and more compact vertically
	•	Clearly anchor trust at the end of the page
	•	Look finished, intentional, and restrained
