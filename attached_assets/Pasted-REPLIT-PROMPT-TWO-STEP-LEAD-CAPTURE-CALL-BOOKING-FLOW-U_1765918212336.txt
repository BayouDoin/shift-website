REPLIT PROMPT — TWO-STEP LEAD CAPTURE + CALL BOOKING FLOW

Update the existing Shift Systems website so that all primary CTAs trigger a two-step modal flow:

Step 1 collects contact information.
Step 2 allows the visitor to book a call.

Do not redesign the site. Integrate cleanly into the existing UI and brand.

⸻

1. CTA BEHAVIOR

Update the following buttons so they all trigger the same flow:
	•	“Book a Call”
	•	“See What We’d Automate in Your Business”

Clicking any of these should open a modal dialog.

⸻

2. MODAL — STEP 1: CONTACT INFO (FIRST SCREEN)

This must be the first thing shown when the modal opens.

Form fields
	•	Full Name (required)
	•	Email Address (required)

Primary button

Continue

Supporting text (small, subtle)

No spam. No sales pressure. Just a quick workflow review.

Behavior
	•	Validate both fields before continuing
	•	Store name and email in local state
	•	Do NOT allow skipping this step
	•	On submit, transition to Step 2 without page reloadict

⸻

3. MODAL — STEP 2: BOOK A CALL (SECOND SCREEN)

After Step 1 submission, replace modal content with a scheduling view.

Header

Schedule Your 20-Minute Workflow Review

Subtext

You’ll leave with a clear automation plan and next steps.

Scheduling
	•	Embed a Calendly scheduler inline using an iframe
	•	Use a placeholder Calendly link that can be easily replaced
	•	Pass name and email into Calendly if supported
	•	Allow booking a 20-minute meeting

Optional helper text (small)

If now isn’t a good time, we’ll follow up by email.

⸻

4. UX REQUIREMENTS
	•	Modal centered with dark overlay
	•	Smooth transition between Step 1 and Step 2
	•	Close button in top-right
	•	Responsive on mobile
	•	Keyboard accessible
	•	Preserve page scroll on close

⸻

5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
	•	Implement as a reusable Modal component
	•	Use React state to manage steps
	•	Do not require authentication
	•	Do not add a backend unless already present
	•	Calendly embed in its own component
	•	Keep collected contact data in state for later use

Optional but recommended:
	•	Stub event hooks for:
	•	CTA click
	•	Step 1 submit
	•	Calendly booking

⸻

6. COPY & COMPLIANCE CONSTRAINTS
	•	No aggressive sales language
	•	No pricing mentions
	•	Do not imply obligation
	•	Tone should be calm, consultative, and professional
	•	Match existing typography and spacing
	•	Do not auto-submit data to external services unless configured

⸻

7. COMPLETION CHECK

When complete:
	•	All primary CTAs open the modal
	•	Step 1 (name + email) is mandatory
	•	Step 2 (calendar booking) follows
	•	Users can close at Step 2
	•	You retain contact info even if they don’t book

⸻

OPERATOR NOTE (IMPORTANT)

Structure this so later we can:
	•	Send unbooked leads to email follow-up
	•	Add UTM tracking
	•	Route leads into CRM or automation workflows

Do not implement those yet. Just architect for it.
