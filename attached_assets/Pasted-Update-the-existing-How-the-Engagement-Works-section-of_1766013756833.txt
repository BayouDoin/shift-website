Update the existing “How the Engagement Works” section of the Shift website to better align with AI-curious businesses that may not yet have defined workflows.

Do not redesign the page or alter other sections. Only update copy and labels in this section.

⸻

1. Section Header and Subheader

Keep the section title:

How the Engagement Works

Replace the existing subheader with:

Designed to help you make sense of where AI fits, without overcommitting or overengineering.

⸻

2. Step 1 — Rename and Rewrite

Replace:

Start with a 20-minute workflow review

With:

Start with an AI Strategy Call

Replace the description text with:

A short conversation to understand how your business operates today and where work feels heavier than it should.

⸻

3. Step 2 — Reframe Language

Keep the step number and structure, but update the title and description.

Replace the step title with:

Identify where AI can take work off your plate

Replace the description with:

We identify repetitive, tedious, or draining work that AI can realistically own or support.

⸻

4. Step 3 — Soften Implementation Framing

Replace the step title with:

Design what makes sense to implement first

Replace the description with:

We outline a clear, realistic path forward focused on removing friction and delivering quick wins.

⸻

5. Supporting Bullets (Keep These)

Do not change the following bullets. Keep them as-is:
	•	No prep required
	•	No obligation
	•	Clear next steps after the call

⸻

6. CTA Supporting Text (Important Fix)

Replace:

You leave with a clear automation plan.

With:

You leave with clarity on what AI should take over and what to do next.

This text should appear directly below the CTA button.

⸻

7. Copy Constraints
	•	Do not use the word “workflow” anywhere in this section
	•	Do not imply existing systems must already be in place
	•	Do not add technical jargon
	•	Keep tone calm, consultative, and clarity-focused
	•	Match existing typography, spacing, and layout

⸻

Completion Criteria

When finished, this section should:
	•	Feel safe and welcoming to AI-curious businesses
	•	Emphasize clarity over critique
	•	Align emotionally with the “tasks you dread” CTA
	•	Avoid assumptions about workflow maturity
