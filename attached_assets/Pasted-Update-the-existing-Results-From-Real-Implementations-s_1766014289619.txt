Update the existing “Results From Real Implementations” section to better align with the site’s “less friction, relief, and clarity” positioning.

Do not change metrics, company names, or the overall layout. Only update section framing and add interpretive context as described below.

⸻

1. Section Title and Subheading

Keep the section title:

Results From Real Implementations

Replace the existing subheading with:

Different businesses, different challenges. The common thread is removing work that drains time, attention, and momentum.

This line should appear directly under the section header.

⸻

2. Add an Interpretive Line to Each Case Study

For each case study, after the Outcome, add a single, short interpretive sentence that explains what the result felt like in practice.

These lines should be lighter in visual weight than the Outcome text.

⸻

Cisco — Add this line after the Outcome
This removed constant follow-up pressure and made execution more predictable across the sales process.

⸻

Intuit — Add this line after the Outcome
This reduced manual coordination and helped teams focus on higher-value work instead of chasing leads.

⸻

Gate Gourmet — Add this line after the Outcome
This replaced manual oversight with systems that surfaced issues automatically instead of reactively.

⸻

Local Law Firm — Add this line after the Outcome
This freed up staff time and reduced the mental load of managing intake and paperwork.

⸻

3. Bottom Anchoring Takeaway (Replace Existing Line)

Replace the current bottom line:

In most engagements, the first automation pays for itself within weeks.

With:

Across industries, the pattern is the same: remove the draining work, and everything else moves faster.

This line should feel reflective, not sales-oriented.

⸻
