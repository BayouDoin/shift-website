Update the existing Shift Systems website with the following changes. Do not redesign the entire site. Preserve the current layout, styling, and components unless explicitly noted.

⸻

1. Rename the section

Change the section title from:

“Proven Results”

to:

“Results From Real Implementations”

Add this line directly beneath the section title:

These are examples of where automation produced measurable impact, not just efficiency.

⸻

2. Replace the existing case study cards with structured stories

For each case, use the following structure and keep it visually scannable:
	•	Company name as the primary heading
	•	Four labeled rows:
	•	Context
	•	What Was Broken
	•	What Was Built
	•	Outcome

Maintain consistent spacing and typography across all cases.
