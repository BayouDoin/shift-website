Update the existing “What We Build” section of the Shift website to better reflect a clarity-first, friction-removal positioning.

Do not redesign the page or modify other sections. Only update copy, labels, and section headings as described below.

⸻

1. Rename the Section

Replace the section title:

What We Build

With:

Where AI Removes Friction

⸻

2. Replace the Section Subheading

Replace the current subheading text with:

These are the areas where AI most often removes tedious, draining work and makes day-to-day operations feel lighter.

⸻

3. Rewrite Category Content

Keep the existing four category blocks and layout. Update only the text inside each block as follows.

⸻

Add the following single sentence at the bottom of the section, styled subtly and smaller than body text:

⸻

5. Copy Constraints
	•	Do not introduce new services or tools
	•	Do not remove any existing categories
	•	Do not use the word “workflow” in new copy
	•	Keep tone calm, human, and outcome-focused
	•	Match existing typography and spacing

Completion Criteria

When complete, this section should:
	•	Feel emotionally aligned with “less friction” and “relief” messaging
