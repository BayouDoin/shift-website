Update the footer layout and navigation behavior of the Shift website to improve visual hierarchy, trust, and clarity, and to intentionally route “Contact” to the Book a Call (AI Strategy Call) experience.

Do not change site copy unless explicitly instructed below.
Do not redesign other sections of the site.

⸻

1. Remove the Floating Reassurance Line Above the Footer

Remove the standalone line that appears above the footer:

“No pressure. No sales pitch. Just clarity.”

This line should no longer appear as a separate banner or divider.

⸻

2. Add a Centered Reassurance Line INSIDE the Footer

At the top of the footer, add the following line, centered horizontally:

Clarity-first AI systems. No pressure. No long-term commitments.

Styling guidance:
	•	Slightly larger than footer body text
	•	Muted contrast, not bright white
	•	Light font weight
	•	Increased letter spacing
	•	Add vertical spacing below to separate it from footer content

This line should visually anchor the footer.

⸻

3. Change Footer Layout to a Constrained 2-Column Structure

Replace the current wide 3-column layout with a 2-column layout inside the site’s standard max-width container.

⸻

Left Column — Brand Anchor

Replace the standalone “SHIFT” treatment with a stacked block:

SHIFT
Enterprise-grade AI that removes friction from everyday work.

Styling guidance:
	•	“SHIFT” remains bold and prominent
	•	Tagline appears directly below in smaller, muted text
	•	Left-aligned
	•	Acts as the visual anchor of the footer

⸻

Right Column — Navigation + Social (Stacked)

Create a tight vertical stack with two sections:

Explore
	•	Services
	•	Results
	•	How It Works
	•	Contact (Book a Call)

Connect
	•	LinkedIn
	•	Upwork

Styling guidance:
	•	Section labels slightly bolder than links
	•	Links stacked vertically
	•	Reduce horizontal spacing between brand and links
	•	Do not spread content across the full width

⸻

4. Route “Contact” to the Book a Call Experience

Update navigation behavior so that:
	•	Clicking Contact opens the same flow as Book a Call
	•	This may be a Calendly modal, booking page, or embedded scheduling flow
	•	No separate contact form page should exist

This behavior should also apply to:
	•	Footer “Contact”
	•	Header “Contact” (if present)

⸻

4a. Booking Flow Microcopy (Important)

To avoid confusion or pressure, add the following subtle line inside the booking experience, beneath the main booking header or form:

Prefer email? Start here and we’ll follow up if a call isn’t the right next step.

This line should be visually subtle and reassuring.

⸻

5. Width, Spacing, and Alignment Adjustments
	•	Constrain footer content to the same max-width used across the site
	•	Increase vertical padding slightly
	•	Reduce excessive horizontal whitespace
	•	Keep layout calm, centered, and intentional

⸻

6. Copyright Placement

At the very bottom of the footer, centered and small:

© 2025 Shift. All rights reserved.

No additional copy should appear below this line.

⸻

Design Constraints
	•	Do not add animations
	•	Do not introduce new colors or fonts
	•	Do not add new links or CTAs
	•	Do not add a generic contact form
	•	Maintain the dark, minimal aesthetic
	•	Footer should feel reassuring, intentional, and calm

⸻

Completion Criteria

When complete:
	•	“Contact” clearly means “start a conversation”
	•	The footer visually closes the page with trust and clarity
	•	No pressure or sales framing is introduced
	•	Navigation behavior matches the site’s consultative positioning
